      <h1>About Me </h1>
      <h2>my biggest strengths</h2>
      <p>
        <h3> UX advocacy & relationship building</h3> Through facilitated
        workshops & intentional conversations, I help teams understand the value
        of UX, build a strong emotional connection to users, and work together
        towards a high-value solutions.
        <h3> Finding signal v. noise </h3>I love getting immersed in user
        interviews, finding patterns, problems, & opportunities. I enjoy working
        with PM and engineering teammates to narrow down the key business
        questions we need to answer, and how we can address those questions
        through a variety of discovery methods.<h3> Systems thinking</h3> I love
        understanding how team & user outcomes are often the function of
        multiple variables. I like thinking through problems at the system
        level, project level, and individual level before arriving at potential
        solutions. <h3>Creating lightweight processes that work for teams</h3> I
        like to show my work and the work of my team. I enjoy finding tools and
        easy processes that allow teams to work faster and more joyfully. I am
        allergic to copying and pasting.
